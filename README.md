- What was your motivation? Social Networks are very popular and used commonly to this day. That's why I decided to built this project. It was a great way to work with mongoose and NoSQL while creating an application that has the features of what a common social network has.

- Why did you build this project? I built this project to create a useful platform for users to share their their thoughts, react to thoughts, and create a friend list.

- What problem does it solve? This project doesn't solve any problems. It is a social platform for those who want a simple and easy to use experience. 

- What did you learn? I learned how to create schemas with mongoose as well as understand more about SchemaTypes and Validations.
